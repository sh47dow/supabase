# Supabase

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) adds realtime and RESTful APIs to your existing PostgreSQL database without a single line of code.

## Status

- [x] Alpha: We are testing Supabase with a closed set of customers
- [x] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io). But go easy on us, there are a few kinks.
- [ ] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases
- [ ] Public: Production-ready

We are currently in Public Alpha. Watch "releases" of this repo to get notified of major updates.
