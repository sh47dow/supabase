## Pre-requisites

- Postgres 10+

## What you will need

- `DB_HOST`: defaults to `localhost`
- `DB_NAME`: defaults to `postgres`
- `DB_USER`: defaults to `postgres`
- `DB_PASSWORD`: defaults to `postgres`
- `DB_PORT`: defaults to `5432`


## Setting up replication

For us to receive the streaming data, we need the database to have a free replication slot:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = logical; -- set the replication to "logical" 
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 5; -- We need at least one replication slot to subscribe to
CREATE PUBLICATION supabase_realtime FOR ALL TABLES; -- Set up the publication for us to listen to
```

### Optional

If you want to receive the old record (previous values) on `UPDATE` and `DELETE`, you can set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` like this: 

```sql
ALTER TABLE your_table SET REPLICA IDENTITY = FULL;
```

This has to be set for each table unfortunately.
