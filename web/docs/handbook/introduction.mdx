title: Supabase Handbook
---

Supabase is thinking in public. Everything is online, no matter how raw the current state of things.

This is our public handbook. 

We are completely opensource and this means that you, our users, are also our team members. 

Wherever we can we will support existing opensource tools and libraries.
