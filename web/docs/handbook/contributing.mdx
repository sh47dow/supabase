Want to contribute? Why not jump into our github and:

- submit an issue
- report a performance issue or a part of the documenation that you find confusing
- create a pull request
- try one of our products and give feedback
- translate this website
- [vote on a new client library](https://github.com/supabase/monorepo/issues/5) for your favourite language
- [vote on a new connector](https://github.com/supabase/monorepo/issues/4) for a tool that you use
- spread the word if you like what we are doing

Please refrain from putting us on any launch lists (like Product Hunt) until we are ready for public launch :)
