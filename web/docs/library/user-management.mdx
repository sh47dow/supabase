### Introduction

Supabase makes it easy to manage your users.

When a user signs up, Supabase assigns them a unique ID. You can reference this ID anywhere in your database. For example, you might create a `profiles` table references the user using a `user_id` field.

Supabase provides the routes to sign up, login, log out, and manage users in your apps and websites.

### Sign up

<CustomCodeBlock header="New user." js={signup} />
<br />

Allow your users to sign up and create a new account.

After they have signed up, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

### Log in

<CustomCodeBlock header="Existing user." js={login} />
<br />

If an account is created, users can login to your app.

After they have logged in, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be performed as "that user".

### User data

<CustomCodeBlock header="Get the logged in user." js={userData} />
<br />

Get the JSON data for the logged in user.

### Log out

<CustomCodeBlock header="Clear the user's session." js={logout} />
<br />

After calling log out, all interactions using the Supabase JS client will be "anonymous".

### Error handling

<CustomCodeBlock header="Shows how to parse errors returned from the server." js={errorHandling} />
<br />

### Third Party Logins

We currently support the following OAuth providers:
- Google
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

You can enable providers by navigating to Authentication > Settings > External OAuth Providers and inputting your `Client ID` and `Secret` for each.

To fetch these you need to:

1. Generate `Client ID` and `Secret` ([google](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials), [github](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/oauth/applications), [bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/use-oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud/))
2. Enter Authorized Redirect URI: `http://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` on provider dashboard

You can now test your integration by navigating to: `https://<your-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/authorize?provider=<provider-name>`. This is where you should send your users to authenticate. Options for `provider` are `google`, `github`, `gitlab`, or `bitbucket`.

After authenticating you should be redirected to `<your-site-url>/?access_token=xyzabc&expires_in=3600&refresh_token=abcdef&token_type=bearer`. This base url can be updated on the Supabase dashboard at Authorization > Settings.

The user will now appear in your database in the `auth.users` table.

You can now use the `access_token` in the url above in an Authorize header like: `Authorization: Bearer xyzabc` when making requests to your REST or Realtime APIs in order to authenticate as that user. If using supabase-js then you can set the `accessToken` on the client:

<CustomCodeBlock header="Sets the accessToken inside supabase-js" js={setAccessToken} />
<br />
