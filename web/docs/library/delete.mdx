import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

We will be using these tables as reference for our examples:
```json
{
    "companies": [
      { "Id": 1, "name": "Pied Piper", "employeeCount": 10 },
      { "Id": 2, "name": "Hooli", "employeeCount": 1000 },
      { "Id": 3, "name": "Yao Net", "employeeCount": 100 },
      { "Id": 4, "name": "See Food App", "employeeCount": null }
    ],
}
```

<Tabs
  defaultValue="nodeJs"
  values={[
    { label: 'Node.js', value: 'nodeJs', },
    { label: 'Python', value: 'py', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="nodeJs">

```js
supabase.delete(tableName, options?)

```
Given the `options?` set (if any), this delete all rows from the specified `tableName`.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="py">

```py
# TODO
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Method arguments
### tableName
`required` string  
Name of table in the database that will have its rows deleted.

### options
`optional` object  
All available options and examples it their usage can be found [here](../library/options).

## Additional filtering
To specifically indicate which resources are to be deleted, additional filters can be used.
They can be found [here](../library/filters).

## Example

### Mass delete
Updating employeeCount for all companies.
```js
const deleteCompanies = async () => {
  try{
    let company = await supabase.delete("companies")
    return company
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error: ", error)
  }
}
```

Upon a successful deletion, the status code `204 Accepted` will be returned. 
When getting all companies again, as shown [by this example](../library/get#generic), 
the following will be returned with the status code `200 OK`:
```json
[]
```

### Using filters
Deleting companies where its columnName "name" is equal to "See Food App".
```js
supabase.delete("companies").eq("name", "See Food App")
```

Upon a successful deletion, the status code `204 Accepted` will be returned.
When getting all companies again, as shown [by this example](../library/get#generic), 
the following will be returned with the status code `200 OK`:
```json
[
  { "Id": 1, "name": "Pied Piper", "employeeCount": 10 },
  { "Id": 2, "name": "Hooli", "employeeCount": 1000 },
  { "Id": 3, "name": "Yao Net", "employeeCount": 100 }
]
```
