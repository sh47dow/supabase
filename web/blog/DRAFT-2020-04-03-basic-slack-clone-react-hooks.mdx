- [Building a basic Slack clone with Postgres and React Hooks](/blog/2020/04/03/basic-slack-clone-react-hooks)
- Building a Slack backend [COMING SOON]
- Building a Slack frontend [COMING SOON]
- Adding realtime functionality [COMING SOON]


Throughout the series you'll learn how to use four amazing technologies that scale up to production-ready realtime applications:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - an extremely scalable relational database
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - a JS wrapper for Postgres for instant realtime and RESTful APIs 
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - a JS framework for building server-rendered React apps
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - a CSS framework for quickly styling our frontend app
